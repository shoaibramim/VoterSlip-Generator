# VoterSlip Generator
This is a fully client-side React web application for extracting Bengali (Bangla) voter information from PDF voter lists and generating customized, print-ready voter slips in PDF format. The app works entirely in the browser with no backend or database, converts extracted voter data into a temporary in-memory JSON structure, replaces placeholders in user-provided or predefined PDF templates while preserving layout and fonts, and generates output PDFs with four voter slips per page in A4 or Legal size, ensuring accurate Bengali Unicode rendering without word breaking.
